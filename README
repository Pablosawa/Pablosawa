- 👋 Hi, I’m @Pablosawa
- 👀 I’m interested in defining my programming and career path, I have several interests far beyond programming. I'm interested in growing and learning. Naive but a hardworking individual.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of the It support specialist role.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever my skills adapt to, I'm usually not so confident about the things I'm capable of but if I can help and learn while having a great time I will do it.
- 📫 How to reach me, Everywhere I appear as Pablosawa, so just throw a basic search everywhere.
